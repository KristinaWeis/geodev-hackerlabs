###Create a new map

The eaiset way to create a map is use the [Map Viewer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/use-maps/view-maps.htm). In this lab you will create a new map from existing layers that have been already been published.

2. Go to `MAP`.

3. Use `Add > Search for Layers > ArcGIS Online` to add the following layers from ArcGIS Online:

Hint: Search for `PDX Train` and `PDX Neighborhoods` by (al_geodev)!

```
PDX Train Lines
PDX Train Stops
PDX Neighborhoods
``` 

4. Add all of the layers.

5. Reorder the layers so that the Neighborhoods is on the bottom.

6. Change the base map to your favorite basemap.

7. Save your map.  

NOTE: The default map should look something like [this](http://edn.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=122635222fac4d9fa1b3ee4ed39e64ee).

7. Explore the data by clicking on the map.

Challenge: Use the map viewer to try to improve the name in the TOC.  Also try to improve the default symbols used.

# GeoDev How-to: Find and add data to a map

In this post we’ll learn how to discover and explore data, then add it to a map in ArcGIS Online.

## What is ArcGIS Open Data?

ArcGIS Open Data is a community of open data sites providing users with access to authoritative datasets. Users can discover, explore, and download datasets, as well as import into ArcGIS Online for further visualization and analysis.

## In this How-to you will…

* **Step 1:** Use ArcGIS Open Data to discover a new authoritative dataset and add it to ArcGIS Online.
* **Step 2:** Perform a visualization with the dataset.

**note:** If you are new to ArcGIS, please review the [getting started](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/geodev/blog/2014/12/03/arcgis-geodev-tutorials-getting-started) article before proceeding.

## Step 1: Find a dataset using ArcGIS Open Data

In this section you will search [ArcGIS Open Data](https://opendata.arcgis.com/about) to discover something interesting. Using your [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/sign-up/) subscription, you’ll then add it to a map in ArcGIS Online.

### Search for data on an ArcGIS Open Data site
There are over 800 public sites with authoritative data ready to explore and use for analysis, visualization, and web apps. We’ll use Esri's [Open Data](https://opendata.arcgis.com) site to search all of them in aggregate.

## Step 2: Visualize the data

Raw data in a table isn’t very accessible for most people. Adding a visualization helps to understand the raw data and gain new insights, and we can do this right in ArcGIS Online. Your data is already in the map viewer, so we’re all good to go.

# GeoDev How-to: Find and add data to a map

In this post we’ll learn how to discover and explore data, then add it to a map in ArcGIS Online.

## What is ArcGIS Open Data?

ArcGIS Open Data is a community of open data sites providing users with access to authoritative datasets. Users can discover, explore, and download datasets, as well as import into ArcGIS Online for further visualization and analysis.

## In this How-to you will…

**Step 1:** Use ArcGIS Open Data to discover a new authoritative dataset and add it to ArcGIS Online.
**Step 2:** Perform a visualization with the dataset.

**note:** If you are new to ArcGIS, please review the [getting started](https://geonet.esri.com/groups/geodev/blog/2014/12/03/arcgis-geodev-tutorials-getting-started) article before proceeding.

## Step 1: Find a dataset using ArcGIS Open Data

In this section you will search [ArcGIS Open Data](https://opendata.arcgis.com/about) to discover something interesting. Using your [ArcGIS for Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/sign-up/) subscription, you’ll then add it to a map in ArcGIS Online.

### Search for data on an ArcGIS Open Data site
There are over 800 public sites with authoritative data ready to explore and use for analysis, visualization, and web apps. We’ll use Esri's [Open Data](https://opendata.arcgis.com) site to search all of them in aggregate.

#### Discover data

* Navigate to Esri's [Open Data](https://opendata.arcgis.com) site
* Search for 'Census Block Groups' near Washington DC
* Browse the results and select [Census Block Groups - 2010](http://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e491c38cbb6b4d5788f769742ee0d169_2)

**Explore data**

1. Click on the **Table** tab, explore the data attributes, and familiarize yourself with the data.
2. Select **Pop of 1 race: White** variable → select the left slider of the attribute filter and slide it right to filter the data.
3. Observe the map change.

This dataset has a lot of information. Let’s add it to a map in ArcGIS Online to dive a little deeper and make something cool.

## Step 2: Add the data to ArcGIS Online and visualize it

At this point you have searched for open data, familiarized yourself with its contents, and accessed it from the source. You have an authoritative dataset ready to add to a map for further manipulation.

1. Click back on the **Details** tab
2. Click **OPEN IN ARCGIS** just below the map
3. Sign in using your developer account

Raw data in a table isn’t very accessible for most people. Adding a visualization helps to understand the raw data and gain new insights, and we can do this right in ArcGIS Online. Your data is already in the map viewer, so we’re all good to go.

**TIP:** Learn more about working with the map viewer and changing layer symbols [here](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/create-maps/change-style.htm).

### Change the data's symbology

1. do some smart mappin
2. save your work

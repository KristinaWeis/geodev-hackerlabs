###Create Data

[ArcGIS for Developers](http://developers.arcgis.com) allows you to create and publish hosted web services (feature services) in the cloud on the fly. All you need to do is specify the name and fields for the dataset and save it. In this lab you will create a new feature service. 

###Steps

1. Go to [developers.arcgis.com](http://developers.arcgis.com) and login.

2. In Hosted Data, use New Feature Service to create a new dataset. 

3. Specify the following:

* Title: PDX Points
* Description: PDX Points
* Type: Points
* Tags: Portland

4. Add the following fields:
  
* Name (string)
* Type (string)
* Date (date)

NOTE: You can create as many fiends you want.

5. Choose any symbol and publish. 

6. Click "Edit in ArcGIS Online".  This should load the layer into the Map Viewer.

7. Zoom to Portland, USA.

8. Click Edit > New Feature and add some points to the dataset.

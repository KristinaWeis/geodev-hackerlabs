###Import Data

ArcGIS Online allows you to import [a wide variety of data types](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/supported-items.htm) into the cloud. In this lab you will use [Add items](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm) to add data to your account (as layers) so they can be accessed later by apps and APIs.

###Steps

1. Fork and clone this repo.

2. Find the datasets on your system in the [/data/pdx folder](./pdx). 

3. Go to [www.arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.

4. In My Content, use Add Items to import each dataset into your account.

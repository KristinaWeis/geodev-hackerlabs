###Import Data

ArcGIS Online allows you to import [a wide variety of data types](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/supported-items.htm) into the cloud. In this lab you will use [Add items](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm) to add data to your account. Each dataset is added as [hosted web layer](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/hosted-web-layers.htm) that can be accessed later by apps and APIs.

NOTE: Before you start make sure you have forked and cloned this repo.

###Steps

1. Find the datasets on your system in the [/data/pdx folder](./pdx). 

2. Go to [www.arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login.

3. In `My Content`, use `Add Items` to import each dataset into your account. Make sure you publish each dataset as a feature service. This is optional but try to group the datasets in folders.

e.g.
```  
* PDX Data
 * Neighborhoods
 * Rail Lines
 * Rail Stops
  
* PDX Bike Data
 * Bike Parking
 * Bike Routes
 * Bike Paths and Lanes
```

Challenge: Explore the Share and Edit capabilities of each layer.

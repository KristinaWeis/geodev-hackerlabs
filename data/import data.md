###Import Data

With ArcGIS Online you can import [a wide variety of data types](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/supported-items.htm) into the cloud. In this lab you will use [Add items](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/share-maps/add-items.htm) to add data to your account (as layers) so they can be accessed later by apps and APIs.

###Steps

1. Download [these datasets](./pdx) to your local system. 

2. Go to ArcGIS.com and login.

3. In My Content, use Add Items to import each dataset into your account.

 * Make sure you publish each as a feature service
 * You might want to put related data in separate folders. e.g. 
  
* PDX Data
 * Neighborhoods
 * Rail Lines
 * Rail Stops
  
* PDX Bike Data
 * Bike Parking
 * Bike Routes
 * Bike Paths and Lanes

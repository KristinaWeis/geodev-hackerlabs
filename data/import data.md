###Import Data

Importing data into ArcGIS Online is often one of the steps to every project. Try importing some data to start your project.

###Steps

1. Download the [Portland datasets](./downloads) to your local system. 
2. Go to ArcGIS.com and login.
3. Now import the each dataset with Add Item. 
 * Make sure you publish each as a feature service
 * You might also want to put related data in separate folders. e.g. 
  
  * PDX Data
   * Neighborhoods
   * Rail Lines
   * Rail Stops
  
  * PDX Bike Data
   * Bike Parking
   * Bike Routes
   * Bike Paths and Lanes
